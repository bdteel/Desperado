# Desperado
Game made with art and animation help from Max.

You can download the Desperado folder for the game and then start the .exe file.

For code, see rest of folders, they are labeled.

I promise it isnt a virus, but I have yet to find a way to have windows tell you its ok.

If your character disappears into a wall and doesnt reappear instantly, you have to restart the game, sorry its not that good.
