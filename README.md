# Desperado
Game made with art and animation help from Max. Size of zip: 25.6MB Size after unzipping: 38MB

After downloading the code, navigate to the Desperado folder and run the .exe file. 

I promise it isnt a virus, but I have yet to find a way to have windows tell you its ok, just click "More Details" then "Run Anyway".

For code, see rest of folders, they are labeled.

If your character disappears into a wall and doesnt reappear instantly, you have to restart the game, its a feature not a bug.
